## 1. Driver Model

Every datasource in Rivers is backed by a driver. A driver is a named, stateless factory that creates `Connection` instances. Connections are owned by the pool. Drivers never manage connection lifecycle — they only construct connections on demand.

```
DriverFactory (registry)
    │
    ├─ DatabaseDriver (name → factory)
    │       └─ Connection (pool-owned, execute operations)
    │
    └─ MessageBrokerDriver (name → factory)
            ├─ BrokerProducer (publish)
            └─ BrokerConsumer (receive/ack)
```

Two separate registries exist:
- `DriverFactory::drivers` — `DatabaseDriver` implementations
- `DriverFactory::broker_drivers` — `MessageBrokerDriver` implementations

A single crate can register in both. Which registry activates for a datasource is determined by config — specifically whether the datasource has a `[consumer]` block.

---

## 2. The Five-Op Contract

The `DatabaseDriver` + `Connection` contract is normalized around five fundamental operations. Every driver maps its native API onto these five regardless of the underlying system.

| Op | Semantic | Example native calls |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | Read data — returns rows | SELECT, GET, find, search, XREAD |
| `execute` | Write data — returns affected count | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, set, index, XADD |
| `ping` | Health check — returns empty or error | PING, SELECT 0, test connection |
| `begin` | Start transaction scope | BEGIN, START TRANSACTION |
| `stream` | Continuous read — returns channel/cursor | SUBSCRIBE, XREADGROUP, consume |

In practice, ops 4 and 5 are expressed differently per driver:

- **Transactions** — drivers that support them set `supports_transactions() → true`. Transaction state is managed via `Connection::begin_transaction / commit_transaction / rollback_transaction` on the driver trait. Both the V8 and dynamic-engine cdylib host paths exercise these methods (Phase I, 2026-04-25): V8 via `process_pool/v8_engine/context.rs::ctx_transaction_callback` with a thread-local `TASK_TRANSACTION`, and the dyn-engine via `engine_loader::dyn_transaction_map::DynTransactionMap` keyed by `(TaskId, datasource)` with a `TaskGuard`-driven auto-rollback hook on `dispatch_task` exit. See `rivers-data-layer-spec.md §6.8` for the lifecycle.
- **Streaming** — broker drivers express this through `BrokerConsumer::receive()`, not through `DatabaseDriver`. The two traits are kept separate precisely because streaming is a continuous lifecycle, not a discrete operation.

The `Query` struct carries the op:

```rust
pub struct Query {
    pub operation: String,   // "select" | "insert" | "get" | "set" | "ping" | ...
    pub target: String,      // table / collection / stream / key
    pub parameters: HashMap<String, QueryValue>,
    pub statement: String,   // raw native statement
}
```

Operation inference algorithm when `operation` is not set explicitly by the caller: <!-- SHAPE-7 amendment -->

1. Trim leading whitespace from `statement`
2. Strip leading SQL comments (`--` to end of line, `/* ... */` blocks)
3. Extract first whitespace-delimited token, lowercased
4. Classify: `select|get|find|search` -> Read, `insert|create|add|set|put` -> Write, `update|patch|replace` -> Write, `delete|remove|del` -> Delete, else -> Read (safe default)
5. Explicit `operation` on the DataView or Query always wins over inference
6. Individual drivers may override inference for their own syntax (e.g., Redis commands)

Drivers dispatch to their native call based on the resolved `operation`. Unknown operations should return `DriverError::Unsupported`.

### Normalization contract

All results normalize to `QueryResult`:

```rust
pub struct QueryResult {
    pub rows: Vec<HashMap<String, QueryValue>>,
    pub affected_rows: u64,
    pub last_insert_id: Option<String>,
}
```

Write operations that produce no rows still return `QueryResult` with `rows = []` and `affected_rows` set. Read operations set `affected_rows = rows.len()` by convention. Drivers must never return `rows = None` — use empty vec.

### Error contract

Driver errors must be one of:

```rust
pub enum DriverError {
    UnknownDriver(String),   // DriverFactory lookup miss
    Connection(String),      // connect() failure
    Query(String),           // execute() failure — query error
    Transaction(String),     // begin/commit/rollback failure
    Unsupported(String),     // operation permanently not applicable for this driver
    NotImplemented(String),  // temporary stub — driver not yet wired <!-- SHAPE-6 amendment -->
    Internal(String),        // driver-internal error, unexpected state
}
```

`Unsupported` indicates a permanent inability — the driver exists but the operation is not applicable (e.g., transactions on Redis). `NotImplemented` indicates a temporary stub — the driver or operation will be implemented but is not yet wired. All honest stubs should use `NotImplemented`, not `Unsupported`. <!-- SHAPE-6 amendment -->

Drivers must not panic. All errors must be returned as `DriverError`. Error messages must not contain credential material — password, token, secret strings should be redacted at the driver level before constructing the error string.

---

## 3. Built-in Database Drivers

Registered directly in `DriverFactory::new()`. No plugin loading required.

### 3.1 `faker` (test only)

Internal driver for unit tests. Returns configurable mock results. Not exposed in production builds.

### 3.2 `postgres`

Client: `tokio-postgres`.

- Positional `$1`, `$2` parameter binding
- `supports_transactions() → true`
- `supports_prepared_statements() → true`
- `last_insert_id` via `RETURNING id` — if the result set contains an `id` column, it is extracted as `last_insert_id`
- Connection string assembled from `ConnectionParams` fields

### 3.3 `mysql`

Client: `mysql_async`.

- Positional `?` parameter binding
- `supports_transactions() → true`
- `last_insert_id` from `last_insert_id()` on result

### 3.4 `sqlite`

Client: `rusqlite` (bundled SQLite).

- WAL mode, 5s busy timeout
- Named parameters: `:name`, `@name`, `$name` — auto-prefixed with `:` if no prefix
- Supports `:memory:` via `database = ":memory:"`
- `last_insert_id` from `last_insert_rowid()`
- Type mapping:

| SQLite affinity | QueryValue |
|---|---|
| INTEGER | `Integer(i64)` |
| REAL | `Float(f64)` |
| TEXT (valid JSON) | `Json(Value)` |
| TEXT | `String(String)` |
| BLOB | `String` (UTF-8 attempt, else hex) |
| NULL | `Null` |

### 3.5 `memcached`

Client: `async-memcached` (ASCII protocol).

Operations: `get`, `set`, `delete`, `ping`.

---

## 4. Redis — First-Class Driver

Redis is a first-class built-in driver, not a plugin. It exposes a broader operation set than most drivers because Redis commands map cleanly to the five-op model across multiple data structures.

### 4.1 Operation map

| `query.operation` | Redis command | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `get` | `GET key` | Single row: `{value}` |
| `mget` | `MGET key [key...]` | One row per key: `{key, value}` |
| `hget` | `HGET key field` | Single row: `{field, value}` |
| `hgetall` | `HGETALL key` | One row per field: `{field, value}` |
| `lrange` | `LRANGE key start stop` | One row per element: `{index, value}` |
| `smembers` | `SMEMBERS key` | One row per member: `{member}` |
| `ping` | `PING` | Empty result |
| `set` | `SET key value [EX seconds]` | `affected_rows = 1` |
| `setex` | `SET key value EX seconds` | `affected_rows = 1` |
| `del` | `DEL key [key...]` | `affected_rows = count deleted` |
| `expire` | `EXPIRE key seconds` | `affected_rows = 1 or 0` |
| `lpush` | `LPUSH key value` | `affected_rows = new length` |
| `rpush` | `RPUSH key value` | `affected_rows = new length` |
| `rpop` | `RPOP key` | Single row: `{value}` |
| `lpop` | `LPOP key` | Single row: `{value}` |
| `hset` | `HSET key field value` | `affected_rows = 1` |
| `hdel` | `HDEL key field [field...]` | `affected_rows = count deleted` |
| `incr` | `INCR key` | Single row: `{value}` |
| `incrby` | `INCRBY key increment` | Single row: `{value}` |

Parameters are extracted from `query.parameters` by name: `key`, `field`, `value`, `start`, `stop`, `seconds`, `increment`.

### 4.2 Key namespacing

Redis keys are not namespaced by Rivers automatically. Applications should use explicit prefixes in their query statements. The `target` field in `Query` is used as the key when `statement` is empty.

### 4.3 Connection management

Redis connections use `redis::aio::Connection` with a single multiplexed connection per pool slot. Reconnection is handled by the pool circuit breaker, not the driver.

---

## 5. rps-client Driver

The `rps-client` is a built-in driver that allows application views to make authenticated requests to the Rivers Provisioning Service as a datasource. It is the application-facing complement to the RPS internal integration.

### 5.1 Purpose

Application code should not make raw HTTP calls to RPS. The `rps-client` driver provides a structured, authenticated, pool-managed datasource interface to RPS operations.

### 5.2 Operations

| `query.operation` | RPS endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get_secret` | `POST /secret/fetch` | Fetch a named secret by lockbox URI |
| `validate_token` | `POST /auth/validate` | Validate a node certificate or session token |
| `health` | `GET /health` | RPS health probe |
| `ping` | `GET /health` | Alias for health |

### 5.3 Authentication

All requests to RPS are authenticated using the node's Trust Bundle-issued PASETO token. The token is held in the pool's connection state, not in `ConnectionParams`. Credential rotation is handled naturally — when credentials are rotated via `rivers lockbox rotate`, new connections read the updated value from disk on demand. Existing connections cycle via `max_lifetime` or health check failure. No drain-and-rebuild is needed. <!-- SHAPE-5 amendment: CredentialRotated event removed -->

### 5.4 Configuration

```toml
[data.datasources.rps]
driver = "rps-client"
host   = "rps.internal"
port   = 9443
credentials_source = "lockbox://rps/node-cert"

[data.datasources.rps.connection_pool]
max_size              = 5
connection_timeout_ms = 2000
```

### 5.5 Security constraints

- `rps-client` connections are always mTLS — the driver enforces TLS and rejects plaintext connections
- Connection params must not include raw passwords — the `credentials_source` must resolve to a node certificate PEM, not a password
- All RPS responses are validated for signature before being returned as `QueryResult`
- Secret values returned from `get_secret` are wrapped in opaque handles — the raw value never appears in `QueryResult.rows`

---

## 6. MessageBrokerDriver Contract

Defined in `crates/rivers-driver-sdk/src/lib.rs`.

Broker drivers are stateless factories like database drivers. The difference is they produce `BrokerProducer` and `BrokerConsumer` instances instead of `Connection` instances. These are not pool-managed in the traditional sense — the `BrokerConsumerBridge` owns one consumer per datasource subscription.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait MessageBrokerDriver: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    async fn create_producer(
        &self,
        params: &ConnectionParams,
        config: &ConsumerConfig,
    ) -> Result<Box<dyn BrokerProducer>, DriverError>;
    async fn create_consumer(
        &self,
        params: &ConnectionParams,
        config: &ConsumerConfig,
    ) -> Result<Box<dyn BrokerConsumer>, DriverError>;
}
```

Broker drivers that also implement `DatabaseDriver` register under both registries. The `DatabaseDriver` interface for brokers exposes discrete, request-scoped operations (produce single message, fetch by offset, list topics). The `MessageBrokerDriver` interface is for the continuous consumer lifecycle managed by the bridge.

---

## 7. Plugin System

### 7.1 Plugin discovery

At startup, Rivers scans `config.plugins.directory` for shared libraries (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`). Each file is loaded via `libloading`. Canonical path deduplication prevents the same library from loading twice via symlinks.

### 7.2 ABI version check

Before calling `_rivers_register_driver`, Rivers checks for `_rivers_abi_version`:

```rust
type AbiVersionFn = unsafe extern "C" fn() -> u32;
```

If the returned version does not match `ABI_VERSION` in the SDK, the plugin is rejected with `PluginLoadFailed` event. The library is not unloaded (to avoid UB), but none of its drivers are registered.

### 7.3 Registration call

```rust
type RegisterFn = unsafe extern "C" fn(registrar: &mut dyn DriverRegistrar);
```

Called inside `std::panic::catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(...))`. A plugin that panics during registration emits `PluginLoadFailed` with the panic message and does not bring down the server.

### 7.4 DriverRegistrar trait

```rust
pub trait DriverRegistrar {
    fn register_database_driver(&mut self, driver: Arc<dyn DatabaseDriver>);
    fn register_broker_driver(&mut self, driver: Arc<dyn MessageBrokerDriver>);
}
```

### 7.5 Plugin template

```rust
use rivers_driver_sdk::prelude::*;

pub struct MyDriver;

#[async_trait]
impl DatabaseDriver for MyDriver {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "my-driver" }
    async fn connect(&self, params: &ConnectionParams) -> Result<Box<dyn Connection>, DriverError> {
        Ok(Box::new(MyConnection::new(params).await?))
    }
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _rivers_abi_version() -> u32 {
    rivers_driver_sdk::ABI_VERSION
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _rivers_register_driver(registrar: &mut dyn DriverRegistrar) {
    registrar.register_database_driver(Arc::new(MyDriver));
}
```

### 7.6 Honest stub pattern

Plugins that are planned but not yet implemented should register and return `DriverError::NotImplemented` on all operations. This is preferred over not registering — it makes the driver visible in `GET /admin/drivers` and produces a clear error if accidentally configured. <!-- SHAPE-6 amendment: use NotImplemented for stubs -->

```rust
async fn execute(&mut self, query: &Query) -> Result<QueryResult, DriverError> {
    Err(DriverError::NotImplemented(
        format!("neo4j driver is not yet implemented — operation: {}", query.operation)
    ))
}
```

---

## 8. DriverFactory

`DriverFactory` is the registry used by the pool manager to create connections.

```rust
pub struct DriverFactory {
    drivers: HashMap<String, Arc<dyn DatabaseDriver>>,
    broker_drivers: HashMap<String, Arc<dyn MessageBrokerDriver>>,
}
```

Built-in drivers registered in `DriverFactory::new()`:
- `faker` — test driver
- `postgres` — PostgreSQL
- `mysql` — MySQL
- `redis` — Redis (first-class)
- `memcached` — Memcached
- `sqlite` — SQLite
- `eventbus` — EventBus driver (registered conditionally when any datasource uses `driver = "eventbus"`)
- `rps-client` — RPS client driver

Plugin drivers are merged in from the static plugin registries (`PLUGIN_DRIVERS`, `PLUGIN_BROKER_DRIVERS`) during `DriverFactory::new()`.

Plugin registries are `OnceLock<Mutex<HashMap>>` — populated during plugin loading, read during factory construction. The factory takes a snapshot; plugins loaded after factory construction are not visible to existing pool managers.

### 8.1 Driver lookup

```rust
pub async fn connect(
    &self,
    driver_name: &str,
    params: &ConnectionParams,
) -> Result<Box<dyn Connection>, DriverError>
```

Returns `DriverError::UnknownDriver` if the name is not registered. This fails the datasource at startup if the referenced driver is missing — you will not get a runtime error on first request.

---

## 9. Driver Registration and Discovery

### 9.1 Startup sequence

1. `DriverFactory::new()` — register all built-in drivers
2. `load_plugins()` — scan plugin directory, ABI check, `catch_unwind` registration call, publish `DriverRegistered` or `PluginLoadFailed` events
3. Pool manager construction — per-datasource `DriverFactory::connect()` called once to validate connectivity

### 9.2 Events

| Event | When | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `DriverRegistered` | Successful plugin registration | `driver_name`, `source` (`builtin`/`plugin`), `plugin_path`, `load_time_ms` |
| `PluginLoadFailed` | Any error in loading | `path`, `reason` |

### 9.3 Admin discovery

```
GET /admin/drivers
```

Returns all registered driver names — built-in and plugin, database and broker — as a JSON array. Used by `riversctl doctor` to verify expected plugins are present.

---

## 10. Configuration Reference

### 10.1 Plugin configuration

```toml
[plugins]
enabled   = true
directory = "/var/rivers/plugins"
```

`enabled = false` skips all plugin loading. The directory is scanned non-recursively — plugins must be at the top level.

### 10.2 Datasource referencing a driver

```toml
[data.datasources.main_db]
driver   = "postgres"
host     = "db.internal"
port     = 5432
database = "myapp"
username = "app"
credentials_source = "lockbox://postgres/prod"
```

`driver` must match a registered driver name exactly — case-sensitive. If the driver is not registered at startup, the server fails to start with a clear error.

### 10.3 Datasource extra config

For drivers that need non-standard config (InfluxDB org, Redis key prefix, NATS stream name), use the `extra` table:

```toml
[data.datasources.metrics.extra]
org      = "my-org"
language = "flux"
bucket   = "telemetry"
```

`extra` is a `HashMap<String, toml::Value>` passed to the driver via `ConnectionParams.options` (string-serialized). Drivers access these via `params.options.get("org")`.

### 10.4 rps-client datasource

```toml
[data.datasources.rps]
driver             = "rps-client"
host               = "rps.internal"
port               = 9443
credentials_source = "lockbox://rps/node-cert"

[data.datasources.rps.connection_pool]
max_size              = 5
connection_timeout_ms = 2000
circuit_breaker.enabled           = true
circuit_breaker.failure_threshold = 3
circuit_breaker.open_timeout_ms   = 30000
```
